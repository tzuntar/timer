**Timer.exe**

---

Does the one thing you'd expect it to do. Works on Windows 98 and all the way up to Windows 10/11.

This is one of the first programs I've made. I've kept the executable but thought that I had lost the source code to it.
I still use it on computers running Windows 7 and earlier as those versions didn't ship with a built-in timer app.

Grab a freshly built `.exe` [from the releases page](https://github.com/tzuntar/timer/releases/latest).
